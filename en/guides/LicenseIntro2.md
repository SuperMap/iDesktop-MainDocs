SuperMap iDesktop is a plugin GIS application constructed by SuperMap
iObjects .NET, desktop core library and .NET Framework 4.0. If you want to use
SuperMap iDesktop, you must have a SuperMap license. To meet different
kinds of requirements from users, we provide four versions of SuperMap
iDesktop. Following contents detail all features included in each
version.

  * **SuperMap iDesktop Basic Version** : Supports the spatial data engine SDX+ to manage files. Abundant data management tools are provided like importing/exporting data, data-type conversions, data browse and edit, etc.. Various data processing tools are introduced including data registration, projection transformation and so on. At the same time, lots of tools for creating maps and thematic maps are served. And the tool box to manage data processing tools and data analysis tools is provided. 

A basic version contains 10 modules: mapping, import data, export data,
thematic map, SQL query, data edit, data registration, projection
transformation, attributes, tool box, model builder.

  * **SuperMap iDesktop Standard Version** : Based on the basic version, the spatial data engine SDX+ can manage spatial databases. 3D scenes, 3D effect display, oblique photography and BIM model are introduced. Designing and printing layouts are provided. The version allows you to customize symbols as your needs and generate map tiles. The data versions can be managed and you are allowed to back to an older version. You can extend tool packets through Python scripts, meanwhile, loading extension plugins is supported. With this version, you can create a visual model to perform complex operations in bulk. 

A standard version contains all modules provided in a basic version, and adds
more modules: spatial databases, 3D scene, print layouts, make symbols, map
tiles, manage versions, visualized modeling, Python scripts, load extension
plugins, and map dashboard.

  * **SuperMap iDesktop Professional Version** : Based on the standard version, this version builds in the system customization, advanced mapping, diagram, online sharing, and video map and provides the capabilities of distributed saving, managing big data and big data visualization. The version also allows to access data instantly and to visualize data dynamically. 

An advanced version includes all modules provided in a standard version, and
add series of new modules: system customization, advanced mapping, diagrams,
online sharing, video map, distributed data management, and stream data.

  * **SuperMap iDesktop Advanced Version** : The version is a Ultimate GIS product which includes all modules provided in an advanced version, meanwhile, supports extension development based on the pluggable development frame and provides rich UI controls and tool interfaces and builds in the iObjects development package. 

A development version contains all modules served in an professional version,
and add some new modules: extension development, development frame, UI
controls, iObjects.Net basic development package.

  * **Extension modules** : All extension modules can be purchased singly, but first, you have to purchase any one of a standard version, an advanced version and a development version. Among them, the five modules: system customization, advanced mapping, diagrams, online sharing, and video map are also included in an advanced version, hence, if you have purchased an advanced version or a development version, you have no need to purchase the four modules. Note: A basic version has no support to load an extension module.

The **Toolbox** module in the basic version, the **Manage versions** ,**Python** , and **Map dashboard** modules in the standard version, the**Distributed data management** in the professional version, and the **Machine learning** modules in the extension modules are not supported by **SuperMap iDesktop**. The nine modules will be introduced in future versions. If you have purchased the relative license, you can use these modules once we provide them directly without purchasing them again. The gray items in the picture above are all modules that are not supported in the current version.
