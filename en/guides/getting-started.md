**Data Management**

  * Supports UDB and UDBX engines.
  * Suportive database engines contain: PostGIS, DM, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, BeyonDB MongoDB.
  * Supports POLARDB and GaussDB databases.
  * Open Web maps directly like OGC services, REST services, Google maps, Baidu maps, SuperMap Cloud services, MapWorld services, OpenStreetMap and so on.
  * A huge amount of image data can be managed and visualized in the way of mosaic datasets.
  * Provides various tools to manage data conveniently including Start tab, Catalog, Search, etc. 

**Data Processing**

The choice of many projection and geographic coordinate systems, datasets from different places can be integrated into the same frame. Provides comprehensive data-editing features, and over 30 methods for vector and raster data processing to help users produce professional maps. Besides, provides lots of methods for processing raster, image data and the result data can be used as base maps or involve in analysis. Include:

  * Calculate conversion model parameter values from coordinate systems, and supports 10 coordinate system transformation models.
  * Topologically check and process data.
  * Store 2D/3D map tiles to MongoDB or GeoPackage which greatly improves the efficiency of browsing huge amount of data.
  * Over 200 data processing features are provided including: dissolve, append, rarefy and so on.

**Mapping and visualization**

Provides comprehensive map features like map display, rendering, editing, and so on. Rich visualization, easy-to-use graphics tools for high-quality maps without complex designs. include:

 * Implemented geographically weighted regression analysis. 

**Diagram**

 * 11 kinds of diagrams are provided to visualize datasets' attributes to help people mine relationships, structures and trend of data.
 * Associated display between diagrams is supported to help people analyze characteristic distribution of data in geography.
 * The conversion between a diagram and a thematic map is introduced to quickly show data information in different ways.
 * A diagram can be exported to a picture which can be used in documentation tools like Word, PPT, etc.

**3D**

 * Display and browse multiple-sources data including image data, terrain data, 3D model data, vector data and 2D maps.
 * Provides rich, fascinating 3D special effects to make 3D scene more real like sun light, ocean water, seafloor, underground scenes, particle effects (fire, rain, snow, geysers, etc.).
 * All kinds of 3D spatial analyses and network analyses and results can be saved.
 * The fly management provided make the fly simulation come true.
 * Support the management and display of data such as oblique photography model, BIM, laser point cloud.
 * Local oblique photography data can be uploaded to SuperMap iServer or SuperMap Online.

**Nautical chart**

To save, display and release nautical chart data.

 * Provides the feature of converting nautical chart data based on the newest S-57, IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data.
 * Importing S-57 nautical data is allowed, saving and exporting the nautical chart are allowed too.
 * Displaying nautical data based on the newest S-52 IHO display standardization of electronic charts.
 * Display status of features in nautical charts can be controlled now, and attributes of nautical features are allowed to edit and so people can add or modify them conveniently.
