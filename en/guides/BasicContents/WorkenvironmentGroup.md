Available work environments are stored in the WorkEnvironment folder under the
installation directory of the application program. The configuration files
compose each work environment are gathered in the folder corresponding to the
work environments. When the application program is launched, the default work
environment corresponding to the Default folder under WorkEnvironment folder
is loaded.

You can use commands in the Custom group on the View tab to customize, switch,
and restore the work environment.  ![](img/workenvironment.png)
