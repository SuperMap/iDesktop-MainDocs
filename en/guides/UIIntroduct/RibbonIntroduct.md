SuperMap Deskpro .NET employs the Ribbon-style interface. With the Ribbon, no
longer do you have to wander through the maze of menus, submenus and toolbars
searching for what you want. On the Ribbon are all the commands you need
arranged on the task-oriented tabs.

For the Ribbon-style user interface, each command has a Ribbon control
corresponding to it. Ribbon controls are controls that can be placed on the
Ribbon, including buttons, buttonDropDowns, textBoxes, comboBoxes, etc. In the
red rectangle in the figure below shows the Ribbon, where all controls are
organized.

Tabs and groups are employed to better organize the Ribbon controls. The
Ribbon controls are firstly assigned to different tabs according to their
targets or solutions they are related to, and then they are grouped based on
their functions.
