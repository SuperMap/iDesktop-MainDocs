### ![](img-en/read.gif)Ribbon Introduction

The ribbon-style interface replaces the conventional way of organizing
commands by menus, submenus and toolbars. The advantages of the ribbon-style
interface lie in:

  * More intuitive commands distribution: The commands are well organized through tabs and groups.
  * Much easier to find a command: To access a command, you only need to activate the corresponding tab.

  * In the orange rectangular box shows the Ribbon, where ribbon controls are organized. 
  * On the top of the Ribbon shows tab titles, such as Start, Data, View, etc. You can click a tab title to display the corresponding tab page. 
  * In the orange rectangular box is a group, the Datasource group. The name of a group, displayed at the bottom of the group area, indicates the functions of the commands organized in the group. For example, the Datasource group organizes commands related to datasource operations.
