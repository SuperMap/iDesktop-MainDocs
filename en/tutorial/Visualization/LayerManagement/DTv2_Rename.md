### ![](../../img/note.png)Note

  1. A layer has a name and a caption. They have different functions.

The name of a layer is automatically generated to uniquely identify a map, and it is not editable. The format is Dataset Name@Datasoruce Alias, Continent@world#1 for instance.

By default, layer name and layer caption are identical. However, you are allowed to change the layer caption according to your needs.

  2. You can also press F2 to rename a layer.
