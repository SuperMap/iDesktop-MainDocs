### Instructions

Reassigns datasources or datasets associated with your layer(s) or map(s). If you import the same map template into different workspaces, you can respecify multiple datasets from different datasources.

### Basic Steps

1. Three entries are provided for the function: 
* Right click your vector layer in the Layer Manager and then select the **Reassign Dataset...**.
* Right click your map in the workspace and then select **Reassign Dataset...**.
* Open your map, right click your mouse, and select **Reassign Dataset...**.
2. In the **Reassign Dataset...** dialog box, you can respecify associated datasets for one or more layers.
* If you want to respecify a dataset, you can choose the dataset you want in the dialog.
* You can choose multiple layers from the list and then click the **Unified Settings** to respecify datasets in bulk.
3. If a dataset in the respecified datasource has the same name with an original dataset, it will be matched automatically in the dataset list. Otherwise, the system will warn "The layer does not set the associated dataset.", and you must choose a dataset from the "Dataset" drop-down list.
4. Click **OK** button to finalize the operation The map will be updated immediately.
