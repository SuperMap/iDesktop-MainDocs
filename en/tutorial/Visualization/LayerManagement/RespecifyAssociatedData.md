### ![](../../img/read.gif)Instructions

Reassign datasources or datasets associated with your layer(s) or map(s). If you import the same map template into different workspaces, you can respecify multiple datasets from different datasources.

### ![](../../img/read.gif)Basic Steps

  1. Three entries are provided for the function:
    
  * Right click your vector layer in the Layer Manager and then select the "Reassign Dataset...".
  * Right click your map in the workspace and then select "Reassign Dataset...".
  * Open your map, and then in the map window, right click your mouse and select "Reassign Dataset...".
  2. The "Reassign Dataset..." dialog box appears, where you can respecify associated datasets for one or more layers. Please have a notice for that: types of all datasets you select to uniformly respecify must be the same. 
  3. If you want to respecify a dataset for a layer in your map, you can choose the dataset from the layers list in the dialog then double-click corresponding "Datasource" column to choose a datasource and then double-click corresponding "Dataset" column to choose a dataset.
  4. You can choose multiple layers from the list and then click the "Unified Settings" to open the "Unified Settings" dialog box where you can respecify dasources and datasets. Click OK to finalize the settings.
  5. If a dataset in the respecified datasource has the same name with an original dataset, it will be matched automatically in the dataset list. Otherwise, the system will warn "The layer does not set the associated dataset.", and you must choose a dataset from the "Dataset" drop-down list.
  6. Click OK button to finalize the operation. And the map will be updated immediately.
