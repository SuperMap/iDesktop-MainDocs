title: Layer Control for Vector and Grid Layers
---  


In the layer list, if you have multiple vector and grid layers selected, the following settings are allowed in the setting area.
  
  * **Visible**

Control the visibility of the layers. Check the box to make the layers visible and uncheck to make them invisible.

Uncheck the box to make other settings unavailable.

  * **Max Visible Scale**

Set the maximum visible scale for the layers. Type the value in the text box to the right, 1：100000 for instance. If you zoom in beyond this scale, the layers will not be visible. The default value is 1:0, indicating the max visible scale is not set for the layers.

  * **Min Visible Scale**

Set the minimum visible scale for the layers. Type the value in the text box to the right, 1：500000 for instance. If you zoom out beyond this scale, the layers will not be visible. The default value is 1:0, indicating the min visible scale is not set for the layers.

  * **Transparency**

Control the transparency of the layers. You can directly type a value indicating the transparency of the layers in the text box, or click the right arrow and move the slide bar to change the value. The transparency value is an integer ranging from 0 to 100. 0 indicates opaque and 100 indicates transparent.
