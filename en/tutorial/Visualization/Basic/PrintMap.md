### ![](../../img/read.gif)Introduction

The Print Map function is used to directly print saved map.

### ![](../../img/read.gif)Basic Steps

  1. In Workspace Manager, select the map that needs to be printed, right click and click Print Map.
  2. In the Print Preview dialog box that displays, click the Print button to display the Print dialog box.
  3. In the Print dialog box that displays, select printer and set related print parameters: 
    
  * **Page Range** : Gets or sets the pages that need to be printed.
  * **Copies** : Gets or sets the count of the copies to be printed. The default value of this property is 1.
  * **Print Options:**
      * Printer DPI: The printing resolution of the printer.
      * Printer Mode: Gets or Sets whether to print in the vector or raster mode. Choose vector for fast speed. For better gradient or translucent effects, use the raster mode. 
      * Logic DPI: The logic DPI used when pre-rasterizing the layout. The default is 200. The setting is only available if you choose the raster print mode. It is mainly used for pre-rasterizing the layout when printing. The closer between the Logic DPI and the Printer DPI, the better the printing effects. Typically, the default value is used. If you have a high demand on precision, set a greater value. Please note that a greater logic DPI will consume more memory, therefore reducing the speed.
  4. In the Print dialog box, click Page Setup. Set the paper size, paper orientation, and page margins in the Page Setup dialog box. 

**Use the current page settings** : Click this button to print with the page size and margin set by the layout. Or it will print according to the default parameters of the printer.
  5. Click OK to finish.
