  1. The Map drop-down button is only available when there are open datasources in the current workspace. 
  2. A lot of operations, such as adding data, editing data, analyzing data, etc., can be performed in a map. You can save a map by firstly saving the map to a workspace and then saving the workspace. Only if you have saved both the map and the workspace where the map is located, the map can be opened for future use. 
  3. When closing a map, a prompt box will pop up to ask you whether you want to save the changes or not if there are unsaved changes in the map. You can click Yes to directly save the changes of an existing map. 
  4. When closing a map, a prompt box will pop up to ask you whether you want to save the changes or not if there are unsaved changes in the map. If it is a new map that hasn't been saved, the Save Map as dialog box will show up for you to save the map and changes. If you want to keep the map for future use, you have to save the workspace where the map is located.
