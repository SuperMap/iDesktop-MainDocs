### Complete Line

The Complete Line combo box ensure the line symbols are displayed completely, contributing the the optimization of line display.

If the line length is less than a unit of the cycle length of the line symbol or is not the integer multiple of the line symbol, the lack part will not be displayed. The Complete Line command will calculate considering the line length and line symbol length to draw a line whose length is very similar to the original line.

Below shows the incomplete display of the line symbol [](img-en/LineSymbol.png).
