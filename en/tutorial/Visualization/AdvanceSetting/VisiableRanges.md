### Min/Max Text Size

Set the minimum and maximum sizes of the text that can be displayed in the map. Text objects beyond this ranges will be hidden. When zooming in or out a map, the text can zoom with the map. The commands help you control the display of the text objects within a scale range.

The unit for the two values are millimeters.
