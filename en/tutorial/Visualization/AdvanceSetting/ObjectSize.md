title: Setting the Minimum Visible Size
---  


### Min Object Size

Set the minimum visible size in millimeters for objects in the current layer. When zooming in or out the map, the geometric object would be hidden if the width or height of the bounding box of the object is greater than the value you set here. You can directly type in the box to specify the minimum visible size of objects in layers.
