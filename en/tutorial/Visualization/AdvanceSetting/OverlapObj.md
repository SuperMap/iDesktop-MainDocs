title: Filtering out Overlapping Text in a Map 
---  

### Show Overlap

When the map scale is relatively small and there are too many text objects in the map, some text objects may be hidden by some others. The box unchecked, the text objects will be filtered to display in order to avoid overlap. However, if you want to display all text objects, check the Show Overlap box. Except for controlling how to display the overlapped text objects, the command can also be used to deal with the overlay of elements in thematic maps.
