title: Setting Region Layer Styles 
---  


Two ways are provided to set the style of region layer: **Styles tab** and **Layer Style panel**.

### ![](../../img/read.gif) Styles tab

The Fill Style group under the Styles tab for map window organizes functions for setting fill symbol styles for region objects in the current layer. The Fill Style group is only available when the current layer is a region layer.

  
* **Fills**

With the Fills button, you can set fill patterns for the selected region objects in the current region layer. The Fills button is only available when Gradient Mode is set to None.
  
  * When you click either the Fills image or the arrow below Fills, the fill symbol panel will be displayed for you to access fill symbols provided in the fill symbol library. The fill symbols most recently used are listed on top.
  * You can select a fill symbol in the panel to apply it to the selected region objects, or click More Symbols in the panel to display the Fill Symbol Selector dialog box, in which you can set the properties before applying a fill symbol to the region objects in the current region layer. 
  * Regions in the layer will be instantly rendered with selected fill style.

* **Foreground**

The Foreground button are respectively used to specify the foreground color of the filled region objects in the current region layer.

  * To set the foreground color of the fill regions, click the corresponding button to display the color panel, then you can either click Pick to pick a color from your screen, directly select a color on the panel, or click More Colors at the bottom of the panel for custom settings. 
  * Beside that, you can click More Colors in the color panel to display the Color dialog box for custom settings.
  
* **Transparency**

You can set the transparency of region objects in a region layer.

  * You can directly type a number between 0 (fully transparent) to 100 (opaque) in the Transparency box. Also, you can click the arrow next to the Transparency box and move the scroll bar that appears. Note that the transparency of the outlines of the regions will not change.Click the Brightness button to display the slide bar as shown below.
  * The value range is from 0 to 100. The greater the value, the more transparent the symbols are. Settings here only specify the transparency of the region fill, but not the boundaries.

* **Group Dialog Box**

You can change the region style in the group dialog box for region symbols to get favorable effects.

  * About settings in the group dialog box, please refer to [Setting Fill Styles](FillSymStyle.htm).
