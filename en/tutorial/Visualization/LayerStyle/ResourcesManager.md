title: Managing Symbol Resources 
---  


Symbol resources are managed with symbol libraries. The marker, line and fill symbols are respectively managed with the marker, line and fill symbol libraries.

The application program manages the symbol libraries with the symbol library window. For the marker, line and fill symbol libraries, only one can be loaded to the symbol library window for management at a time.
