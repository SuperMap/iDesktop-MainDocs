* **Transparency** : The transparency of the fill symbol. You can specify the transparency of the fill symbol by typing in the integerUpDown, or by moving the slide bar that appears when clicking the right arrow. The transparency is between 0 and 100, with 0 being fully opaque and 100 being fully transparent.
* **Gradient Fill** : Fills with a color gradient instead of the fill symbol specified at Step 1. The two-color gradient from foreground to background will be employed.
* **Parameters for Gradient Fill** :

**Type** : The mode of the gradient fill. 5 modes are provided.

(1) None: Fill with the fill symbol specified at Step 1 instead of the color gradient.

(2) Linear: The linear gradient is the most basic of all gradients, a simple linear transition between two colors.

(3) Radial: Radial gradient that starts from the gradient center.

(4) Conical: Conical gradient that looks like a cone.

(5) Square: The square gradient produces a square blend, imitating the visual perspective in a corridor or the aerial view of a pyramid.
