You can set the style for the selected text through the **Styles tab** or
**Layer Style **panel. The text style can be set only when there is at least
one text object selected in the currently editable text layer.

###  Styles tab

All features in the "Text Style" group under the "Styles" tab are used for
setting styles of texts and can be available only when there is at least one
text object selected in an editable layer.

You can change text styles through setting related parameters.

### Controls organized in the Text Formatting group:

* You can directly specify the font you want to used from the dropdown list. In the dropdown list, you can type a letter to quickly locate fonts beginning with the letter. 
* **Font Size** drop-down list allows you to change the font size. 
* The **Bold** icon is used for making text bold. 
* The **Italic** icon is used for italicizing text. 
* The **Outline** icon is used for outlining text.
* The **Underline** icon is used for underlining the selected text. 
* The **Strikethrough** icon is used for drawing a line through the middle of text. 
* The **Shadow** icon is used for adding shadow effects to text.
* The **Fixed Size** icon is used for fixing the size of text. When this button is highlighted, the size of the selected text will not change when you zoom your map in or out. 
* The **Transparency** icon is used for adding background effects to text. You can't enable the icon and the **Outline** icon at the same time.
* The **Foreground** icon is used for changing the text color. Click the button to display the color panel where you can directly select a color or click More Colors at the bottom to define one.
* The **Rotation** icon is used for specifying a rotation angle of text. You can click the button, and then type an angle in the text box or tune the spinner to the right of the text box to change the rotation angle of the text.
* You can set how to align text objects. Four alignments are provided: left-aligned text, centered text, right-aligned text, and justified text. 
* **Text Template** : The Gallery provides some common templates. You can select any one of them to apply to text. 

###  Layer Style panel

Right click your text object and select **Style** to open the **Layer Style**
panel where you can view all parameters relative to the selected text object.
If your layer is editable, you can reset its parameters. Features in the panel
is coincident with those in the Text tab in the Properties. So for detail
descriptions, please refer to [Text properties window -
Text](../Interaction/TextPropertyDia).

### Note

1. If you have selected multiple types of objects (text, points, lines, polygons, etc.) from different layers at the same time, the Text Formatting group will only be usable if the text layer is above other layers with selected objects.
