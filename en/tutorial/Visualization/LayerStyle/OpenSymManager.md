title: Opening the Symbol Libraries
---
The Symbol Library Window appears in two forms: the Symbol Selector window and Style Settings window. The former one is mainly used to browse, manage symbol library files. Except for those functions, the Style Setting window can also be used for setting the symbol styles. The operations in the two windows are the same.

You can open the Symbol Library window through:

1. **The Workspace Manager**

In the Workspace Manager, click the plug sign before the Resources node to display the child nodes for the Marker Symbol Library, Line Symbol Library, and Fill Symbol Library.

2. **The Layer Manager**

In the Layer Manager, you can double click the symbol icon for a layer to open the Styles window.

3. **The Styles Tab**

The Styles tabs associated with the map or layout windows allows you to open the Styles window through commands on the Ribbon.

4. **Other Ways**

You have some other ways to open the Symbol Library window (Style Settings window). For instance, you can open the Style Settings window when setting item styles for the thematic maps.
