The template library explorer is used to manage the subgroups in the template library.

### Template Library Explorer

The templates are logically organized in different groups in the template library. For each template library, there is only one root group. templates can be placed in the root group or its subgroups. Each subgroup can contain one or more templates or subgroups.

The template library explorer allows you to visually manage the subgroups of the template library. The root group and subgroups of the template library are displayed in a tree hierarchy based on its original structure in the template library explorer. The root node of the tree corresponds to the root group of the template library, and each child node of the tree corresponds to a subgroup of the template library.

You can click a node in the tree to display the its templates and subgroups in template pane. Subgroups are displayed as folders in the template pane.
