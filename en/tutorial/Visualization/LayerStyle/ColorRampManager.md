Manages the color schemes used in the program. SuperMap provides a set of commonly used color schemes in the Color Scheme Manager. Certain color schemes are prepared for particular use, like the elevation color scheme. Besides, you are allowed to create your own color schemes to satisfy your needs.

More than 190 default color schemes are provided by default. Each default color scheme is stored individually in a separate folder. The default storage location is Installation directory\Templates\ColorScheme\\.
