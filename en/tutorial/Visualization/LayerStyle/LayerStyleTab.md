title: Setting Layer Styles
---
SuperMap provides two ways to set the styles for point/line/region layers: Styles tab and Layer Style panel.

  * **Layer Style panel** : Double click the layer whose style you want to set, and then the "Layer Style" panel appears, where you can set styles for points, lines, polygons or texts.
  * **Styles tab** : In the Styles tab, four control groups are provided for setting point, line, polygon, text styles. You can only set styles for objects in the current layer. When setting styles for objects in the layer, the results will be instantly reflected on the map.

**Note** : The Styles tab for map window is bound to the map window. The tab shows up on the Ribbon only if the current active window is a map window.
