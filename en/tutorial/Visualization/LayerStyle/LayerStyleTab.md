title: Setting Layer Styles

SuperMap provides two ways to set the styles for point/line/region layers: **Styles Settings** tab and **Layer Style** panel.

* **Layer Style panel** : Double click your layer to open the **Layer Style** panel where you can set styles for points, lines, polygons or texts.
* **Styles** tab: In the Styles tab, four control groups are provided for setting point, line, polygon, text styles. You can only set styles for objects in the current layer. When setting styles for objects in the layer, the results will be instantly reflected on the map.

**Note** : The Styles tab is bound to the map window. Therefore, it will display on Ribbon when you active a map window.
