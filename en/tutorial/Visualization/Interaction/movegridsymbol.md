title: Moving Graduated Symbols
---
### Introduction

The Move Graduated Symbol command allows you to move the graduated symbol of the selected object for the graduated symbol map. You can use this command to avoid overlap and optimize the display effects of graduated symbol maps.

### Steps

1. Select the object whose graduated symbol you want to move. 
2. Click Move Symbol on the Graduated Symbol group in the Thematic Map tab.
3. Click at the position to which you want to move the symbol. You can click again to change the target position of the symbol. 

### Note

* There must be graduated symbol maps in the current map window.
* For point or line datasets, you need to select a point or line and then move the corresponding graduated symbol. 
* You don't need to select the region object if you want to move its corresponding graduated symbol. You only need to click in the region object to specify the target position. To move the graduated symbol out of the region object, you need to select the region object first.
