### ![](../../img/read.gif)Introduction

The Move Graph Symbol command allows you to move the graph symbol of the selected object for the graph map. You can use this command to avoid overlap and optimize the display effects of graph maps.

### ![](../../img/read.gif)Basic Steps

  1. Select the object whose graph symbol you want to move. 
  2. Click Move Symbol on the Graph group in the Thematic Map tab.
  3. Click the Move Graph Symbol button and click at the position to which you want to move the symbol. You can click again to change the target position of the symbol.

### ![](../../img/read.gif)Note

  * There must be graph maps in the current map window.
  * For point or line datasets, you need to select a point or line and then move the corresponding graph symbol. You don't need to select the region object if you want to move its corresponding graph symbol. You only need to click in the region object to specify the target position.
