title: Delaying Refresh with Rolling Wheel
---
### Introduction

Selects the **Delay Refresh with Rolling Wheel** check box, which is used to
control whether the map in the current window delays refresh with the rolling
wheel. If this function is not enabled, the real-time refresh speed of the map
is relatively slow. We suggest that you enable this function to improve the
browsing speed. This check box is selected by default.

### Basic Steps

Click the **Operation** and check the Delay Refresh box, the function of
delaying refresh with rolling wheel is activated, the map will be reloaded in
0.4 second after the roller rolls.
