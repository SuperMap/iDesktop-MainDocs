**Barrier Points Operations** : Adding barrier points, removing barrier points, and moving barrier points.

  * **Add by Mouse** : Click in the map window to add a barrier point.
  * **SQL expression** : Type a SQL statement, and the barrier points that meet the expression will be added.
  * **Import** : Import the point dataset as the barrier points.
* **Remov Barrier Points**: Select one or more barrier points (press and hold the **Shift** key to select multiple points) under **Barrier Node** of **Instance Management**. Select **Remove** in the right-click menu or press **Delete** key to remove them.
