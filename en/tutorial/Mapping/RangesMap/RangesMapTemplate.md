### Introduction

The template-based thematic mapping enables you to make ranges maps easier and
reuse the template.

Note that the field in this thematic map must be existed, otherwise the
template is not invalid. In this case, a dialog box will pop up "Thematic map
cannot display properly because the expression doesn't exist. Please specify
the expression." So users should respecify a field.

### Basic Steps

1. In the Thematic Map dialog box Ranges group, select a ranges thematic map template, you can use the template style to create a piece of thematic map.
2. A ranges map is created based on the selected template and the thematic map is added to the Layer Manager as a thematic map layer.
3. All system and custom templates are loaded into the Thematic Map Manage dialog box. To know how to manage the templates, please refer to [Templates Manager](RangesTemplateManager).

### Note

The Ranges Map Manager will show up after creating a ranges map for a vector
layer. You can change the default settings in the Ranges Map Manager to get
more favorable effects.
