dialog box will pop up, as shown below.

### Basic Steps

2. Click Ranges or Ranges label for administrative region in the Label Map list.
3. A ranges label map in default style is created for the vector layer and the thematic map is added to the Layer Manager as a thematic map layer.

after creating a ranges label map for a vector layer. You can change the
template settings in the Ranges Label Map Manager to get more favorable
effects.
