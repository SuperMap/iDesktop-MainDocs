### Introduction

The Ranges Label Map Manager, also called the group dialog box for the Label
group allows you to change the settings of a ranges label map for more
favorable effects.

### Basic Steps

1. Select a ranges label map for a vector layer in the Layer Manager and right click. Select Modify Thematic Map. All related parameters can be set on the Ranges Label Maps window.
2. Thematic Map Layer: Display the current thematic map name.

### The Region-based Range-Label Thematic Map Manager organizes three tabs:
Properties, Styles and Advanced.

Details:

[The Properties tab](PropertiesDia)

[The Styles tab](RangesStyleDia)

[The Advanced tab](AdvancedDia)

When changing the settings in the Ranges Label Map Manager, all changes for
the thematic map are instantly shown on the map. To prevent instant refresh,
uncheck the Enable instant refresh box. If the thematic map is not instantly
refreshed during the modification, click Apply at the bottom of the Ranges
Label Map Manager to apply all changes to the thematic map when the
modification is done.

### Note

1. You can save a thematic map you have created as a template for reuse. Please refer to [Save to Thematic Map Template Library](../Methods/DTv2_LoadStyleThemeTempl).

2. After saving to the template library, the template will be displayed in the Templates drop-down list in the Graph on the Thematic Mapping tab and you can apply it to other thematic maps.
