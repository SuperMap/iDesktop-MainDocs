dialog box will pop up, as shown below.

### Basic Steps

1. Select a vector layer in the Layer Manager.
2. Click Composite or Composite label for road code in the Create Thematic Map dialog box.
3. A composite label map in template style is created for the vector layer and the thematic map is added to the Layer Manager as a thematic map layer.
