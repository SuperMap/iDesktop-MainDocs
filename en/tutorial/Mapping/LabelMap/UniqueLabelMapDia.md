### Instructions

You can change the settings of all parameters of your unique thematic map with
the thematic property panel to obtain the thematic effect as needed.

### Basic steps

1. Select your unique label thematic map and right click on it, and then select "Modify Thematic Map..." to open the thematic map manager panel where all related setting information is shown on.
2. **Thematic Map** : shows the thematic map name. Three tabs in the panel are organized: "Properties", "Styles", and "Advanced".

The specific instructions are:

 ["Properties"](PropertiesDia)

 ["Styles"](UniqueStyleDia)

 ["Advanced"](AdvancedDia)

All settings in the panel will be reflected into the current window instantly
if you check the checkbox "Apply Immediately". Otherwise, when you set some
parameters to new values, you should click the button "Apply" at the bottom of
the panel.

### Notes

1. Your own thematic maps can be saved as templates for further use, for more detail, please refer to [Save as to the template library](../Methods/DTv2_LoadStyleThemeTempl).

2. You can create a new thematic map by loading a template saved in the template library.
