### Introduction

Select a vector layer in the layer manager. Select the Create Thematic Maps in
the context menu, and select Label Map in the list. Select Matrix and Label
matrix for weather forecast to create a label matrix map for the current
vector layer.

When using the thematic map templates, it needs to make sure that the fields
exist. If the current layer does not have the fields of thematic map, a prompt
dialog box will pop up, as shown below:

### Basic Steps

1. Select a vector layer in the Layer Manager.
2. Click Label Matrix or Label matrix for weather forecast in the New drop-down list.
3. A label matrix map in default style is created and the thematic map is added to the Layer Manager as a thematic map layer.

### Note

The Label Matrix Map Manager will show up after creating a label matrix map
for a vector layer. You can change the default settings in the Label Matrix
Map Manager to get more favorable effects.
