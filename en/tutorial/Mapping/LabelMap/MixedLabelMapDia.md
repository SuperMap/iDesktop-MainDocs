### Introduction

The Composite Label Map Manager, also called the group dialog box for the
Label group allows you to change the settings of a composite label map for
more favorable effects.

### Basic Steps

1. Select a composite label map for a vector layer in the Layer Manager and click the group dialog box button at the bottom right corner of the Label group.
2. Thematic Map Layer: Display the current thematic map name.

The Composite Label Map Manager organizes three tabs: Properties, Styles and
Advanced.

[The Properties tab](PropertiesDia)

[The Styles tab](MixedStyleDia)

[The Properties tab](AdvancedDia)

3. When changing the settings in the Ranges Label Map Manager, all changes for the thematic map are instantly shown on the map. To prevent instant refresh, uncheck the Enable instant refresh box. If the thematic map is not instantly refreshed during the modification, click Apply at the bottom of the 3D Ranges Map Manager to apply all changes to the thematic map when the modification is done. 

### Note

1. You can save a thematic map you have created as a template for reuse. Please refer to [Save to Thematic Map Template Library](../Methods/DTv2_LoadStyleThemeTempl).
2. After saving to the template library, the template will be displayed in the Templates drop-down list in the Graph on the Thematic Mapping tab and you can apply it to other thematic maps.
3. Compound ThemeLabel doesn't support to display superscripts and subscripts.
