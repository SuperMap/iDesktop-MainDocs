organized in a matrix. You are allowed to place symbols, pictures, and text in
a matrix to label an object. A matrix label is actually a table with n rows
and m columns. Each cell in the table corresponds to a thematic variable and
can display a picture, symbol or the text. Moreover, each cell can have a
table with n rows and m columns embedded in it.
