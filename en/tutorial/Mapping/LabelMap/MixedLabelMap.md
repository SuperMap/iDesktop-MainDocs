Labels are grouped by positions or separators. Every separate part has a
single label style.

There are two methods for splitting: by position and by separator.

* By position: The cell is 2, which indicates that the label is divided into two parts. The number 2 between part1 and part 2 indicates that the first part contains 2 characters (from beginning), and the rest is the second part. The two parts have different label styles. 
* By separators: Labels are separated by a specified separator. This separator can be number, character, underline, space, etc. The maximum is 5 parts. Each part has a single style.
