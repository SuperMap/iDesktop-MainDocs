The dot density thematic map is another type of thematic map used to represent
quantities, similar to ranges thematic maps and graduated thematic maps. But
instead of using colors, patterns, or symbol sizes to symbolize, dot density
thematic maps use density of dots to represent the value of an attribute
associated with a region. Each dot represents a number of units, and the
product got by multiplying the number of dots in a region and the units each
dot represents is the value of the attribute of that region.

Click the Dot Density Map in the Thematic Mapping group to create the Dot
Density Map. Click to select a dot density map template for users. Besides,
you can customize the maps through the group dialog box for the Dot Density
