### Introduction

The Unique Values Map Manager, also called the group dialog box for the Unique
Values group allows you to change the settings of a unique values map for more
favorable effects.

### Basic Steps

1. Select a unique values map for a vector layer in the Layer Manager and click Modify Thematic Map. In the Unique Values Map window, information about the current map is displayed.
2. Different types of vector layers are slightly different when creating unique values map. The user needs to be set according to the actual use.

There are two tabs: Properties and Advanced. The default contents are the
Properties. Users can set the parameters of ThemeLabel in these two tabs. The
details are as follows:

[Properties](PropertiesDia)

[Advanced](AdvancedDia)

3. When changing the settings in the Unique Values Map Manager, all changes for the thematic map are instantly shown on the map. To prevent instant refresh, uncheck the Enable instant refresh box. If the thematic map is not instantly refreshed during the modification, click Apply at the bottom of the Unique Values Map Manager to apply all changes to the thematic map when the modification is done.

### Note

1. You can save a thematic map you have created as a template for reuse. Please refer to [Save to Thematic Map Template Library](../Methods/DTv2_LoadStyleThemeTempl).
2. When you use the template saved in the template library to create a thematic map, you need to open the Create Thematic Map dialog box, select the saved template in the template library of the corresponding thematic map type and apply it to the production of thematic maps of other similar types of datasets.
