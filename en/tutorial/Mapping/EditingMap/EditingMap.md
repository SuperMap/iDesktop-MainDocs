Modifying Thematic Maps

allows you to modify unique values, ranges, label, Graph, graduated symbols,
dot density map, custom, grid unique values and grid ranges maps. You can
modify geometry objects in an existing thematic map of the above type. It is
not necessary to edit the raw data can create thematic map again to get
favorable effects.

### Introduction

* When a thematic map and the data based on which the thematic map is created are in the same map window, modifying the thematic map is actually modifying the raw data. For instance, if you pan a geometry object in the thematic layer, the corresponding object in the raw layer will be panned accordingly.
* Because the thematic maps depend on the source data, so if you edit the thematic maps, the source data will be changed. If you don't want to damage the source data, you'd better to backup.

### Basic Steps

1. Create a thematic map for a vector or raster layer in the Layer Manager.
2. Click the Editable button in front of the layer node.
3. Modify geometry objects in the thematic layer. The way is similar to the way of modifying ordinary geometry objects. About how to modify geometry objects, please refer to [Editing Objects](../../DataProcessing/Objects/EditObjects/EdittingGeometry).
