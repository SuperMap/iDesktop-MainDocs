### Introduction

You can create a graduated symbols map based on the template. It is
convenient, but generally doesn't meet your needs. You should change it
according to your practical demands. It is not only easy to use, but also meet
the demands of batch drawing to reuse thematic map templates.

When using the thematic map templates, it needs to make sure that fields
exist. If the current layer does not have the fields of thematic map, a prompt
dialog box will pop up, as shown below:

### Basic Steps

1. Select a vector layer in the Layer Manager.
2. Select a vector layer in the layer manager. Right click and select the Create Thematic Map in the menu. Click a template in the Graduated Symbols, then you can create a graduated symbols map. 
3. A graduated symbols map in template style will be automatically displayed as a thematic layer in the current map window, and the thematic map is added to the Layer Manager as a thematic map layer.

### Note

* The Graduated Symbols window will show up after creating a graduated symbols map for a vector layer. You can change the default settings in the Graduated Symbols Map Manager to get more favorable effects.
* After closing the Thematic Map window, you can double click this layer or right click this layer, and select Modify Thematic Map to open this window.
