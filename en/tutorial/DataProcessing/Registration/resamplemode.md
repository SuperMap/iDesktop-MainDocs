### ![](../../img-en/read.gif)Description

After completing registration for the grid/image dataset, the central position of the pixel moves because of the operations of the original image such as stretching, rotating, etc. and you need to resample the grid/image dataset after registration.

The Mode buttonDropdown in the Grid/Image group provides three kinds of resample methods: the Nearest Neighbor method, the Bilinear Interpolation method and the Cubic Convolution method.

  2. Select a suitable resample mode in the displayed dropdown list, and use this mode to resample the grid/image data.
