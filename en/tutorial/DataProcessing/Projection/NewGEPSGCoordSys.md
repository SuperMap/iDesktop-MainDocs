title: Obtaining Coordinate System by EPSG Encoding
---
### Introduction

The **Coordinate System Settings** dialog box supports the creation of
coordinate systems by EPSG Encoding. European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) is
responsible for maintaining and distributing dataset parameters for coordinate
reference systems, as well as coordinate transformation descriptions. There
are different combinations of ellipsoids, projection coordinates, etc., which
correspond to different ID numbers. This number is called EPSG Code in EPSG.
It represents information such as specific ellipsoid, unit, geographic
coordinate system or projection coordinate system information,and so on. You
can get corresponding coordinate system information through EPSG code.

### Basic Steps

1. In the **Coordinate System Settings** dialog box, click the **Create New Coordinate System** > **Obtained by EPSG Encoding** to open the **Obtained by EPSG Encoding**.
2. In the dialog box, enter EPSG code. EPSG Code is a professional parameter. Each coordinate system has a unique EPSG Code.
3. Click **OK**. And then a coordinate system in the EPSG code will be added under the Custom group.
