title: Obtaining Coordinate System by EPSG Encoding

### ![](../../img/read.gif)Introduction

The "Coordinate System Settings" dialog box supports the creation of 
coordinate systems by EPSG Encoding. European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) is 
responsible for maintaining and distributing dataset parameters for coordinate 
reference systems, as well as coordinate transformation descriptions. There 
are different combinations of ellipsoids, projection coordinates, etc., which 
correspond to different ID numbers. This number is called EPSG Code in EPSG. 
It represents information such as specific ellipsoid, unit, geographic 
coordinate system or projection coordinate system information,and so on. You 
can get corresponding coordinate system information through EPSG code. 

### ![](../../img/read.gif)Basic Steps

  1. In the "Coordinate System Settings" dialog box, click the "Create New Coordinate System" drop-down button and select "Obtained by EPSG Encoding", the "Obtained by EPSG Encoding" dialog box is shown.
  2. In the dialog box, enter EPSG code. EPSG Code is a professional parameter, and its coding ID is different because of the projection coordinate system and the different geographic coordinate system.
  3. Click OK, therefore a coordinate system in the EPSG code will be added under the Custom group.
