title: Enabling Multi-layer Editing
---
The Clipboard group allows you to enable and disable the multilayer editing
function. When the Enable button is highlighted, the multilayer editing mode
is on; otherwise, you can edit only one layer at a time.

  * When you turn on the multilayer editing mode, multiple editable layers can exist in the map window. When an object is selected in the map window, the layer containing the object will be automatically activated.
  * When the multilayer editing mode is off, the map window can contain only one editable layer at a time. You need to manually set a layer editable if you want to edit the layer.
  * The multilayer editing function helps you improve the efficiency when you need to frequently switch between layers for operations.
