### Description

The Delete command lets delete objects by continuously selecting objects.

The Delete command is only active if there are editable layers in the current map window.

### Basic Steps

1. Set the layer in which you want to delete objects editable.
2. Click Delete in the Object Operations group.
3. Select an object to delete it.
4. Continuously click objects to delete them. Click the Delete command again to enable the delete operation.

### Note

1. You can delete objects in multiple layers at the same time if the multilayer editing function has been enabled.
2. When continuously clicking to delete objects, an object can't be deleted from an un-editable layer.
3. When the cursor changes to a status of deleting objects, if you press A on the key board, you can change the cursor status to that of panning, and if you press A again or right click or press ESC, the cursor will restore to the status of deleting objects.
