### ![](../../../img/read.gif)Description

Reverse the direction of the selected line or region objects.

The Reverse command is only active if there are selected line or region objects in the editable layer.

The function can be performed on the following objects: 2D line, 3D line, 2D region, 3D region and compound objects.

### ![](../../../img/read.gif)Basic Steps

  1. Set the layer in which you want to reverse the line or region objects editable.
  2. Select the line or region objects to reverse direction by clicking ![](img-en/ChangeDirctionIco.png).
  3. Click Reverse.

### ![](../../../img/note.png)Note

  1. You can reverse line or region objects in multiple layers at the same time if the multilayer editing function has been enabled.
  2. The reverse operation can only be implemented on the editable line or region objects among all the selected objects.
  3. Changing directions of lines and objects actually creates new lines and regions, so for CAD datasets, when you change the directions of line and region features, the styles for them will be changed to the default ones.
