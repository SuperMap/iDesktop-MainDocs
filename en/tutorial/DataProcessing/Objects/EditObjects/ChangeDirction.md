### Description

Change the order of nodes of the selected line or region objects.

The **Change Direction** button is active when there is at least one line or region object selected in an editable layer.

The function can be performed on the following objects: 2D line, 3D line, 2D region, 3D region, and compound objects.

### Basic Steps

1. Select one object or more geometrical objects (lines, for example) by pressing Shift or Ctrl or dragging and dropping a box.
2. Click **Object Operations** > **Object Edit** Gallery > **Change Direction** to change the order of nodes of each object you selected.

### Note

1. After enabling the **Multi-layer Editing** , you can change the directions of objects from different layers at the same time.
2. No matter how many kinds of objects you have selected from both editable layers and read-only layers, the operation works on the lines and region objects in editable layers. 
3. Changing directions of lines and regions will create new lines and regions essentially. Therefore, for a CAD layer, the styles of lines or regions will change to the default ones after the operation.
