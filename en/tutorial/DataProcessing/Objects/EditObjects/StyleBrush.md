Applies the style of one object to other objects.

### Instructions

* The style brush function applies to CAD layers and text layers.
* By clicking the Style Brush button once, you can apply styles to
multiple objects repeatedly.
* Select multiple geometric objects of the same type at a time and click
the Style Brush button, then the style brush will remember the style (base
style) of the object whose SmID is the smallest. The following selected
objects will be applied with this object style.
* Select multiple geometric objects of different types at a time and click
the Style Brush button, then the style brush will remember the style of object
whose SmID are the smallest for each type. During the style assignment, the
base style will automatically be assigned to others matching the object type,
i.e. point object style can only be applied to point objects instead of line
objects, region objects, text objects, etc. Likewise, line, region and text
object styles can only be applied to other line, region and text objects.
* The style brush function supports cross-layer application, i.e. the base
style can be applied to objects in other layers in current map window.
* If the object is not easy to be selected, you'd better use the style
brush.
