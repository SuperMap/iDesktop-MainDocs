### Introduction

Auto Close Line is used to form closed objects when drawing polylines, curves, multilines, and freehand lines.

Each line drawn in iDesktop has at least 3 nodes. Except straight lines, other kinds of lines support the feature.

### Basic Steps

1. Click **Object Operations** > **Drawing** group > **Drawing Settings** > **Auto-Close Line**. You can also press Shift+C to activate this function. Click on this function again to disable it.
2. When you right-click to finish the drawing of a line, iDesktop will close the line automatically by connecting the first node and the last node.
