Map vectorization is one of the most important ways to get geographic data. To achieve rapid vectorization of image data or paper map data, iDesktop provides symbolic mapping capabilities. After drawing feature objects in a map based on user-specified symbolic templates, iDesktop automatically stores the drawing objects to feature-related datasets, and automatically give the object the default attribute value, which can effectively improve the user's vectorization efficiency. In contrast to the layer style of the map, the newly drawn object is displayed in the layer style, which helps the user to effectively distinguish the geographic elements in the vector process.
Symbolic mapping provides a pre-defined national census geography template, which is based on the national census work standard "GDPJ 03-2013 National Geographic census data requirements and collection requirements" to develop, define the various elements of the dataset name, dataset type, display style, some attributes, and so on. If you want to digitize the contents of the census, you can use the template directly to draw the object. At the same time, iDesktop provides import template, create template, manage template, object drawing, attribute editing and other functions, and then the user can customize the template according to demand, and then vectorize.

**This section contains:**

[### Manage Template](TemplateManager)

Describes how to manage symbolic mapping templates.

[### Symbolic Mapping Application](SymbolicMappingExample)

Introduce how to do symbolic mapping quickly through example.

[### Edit Property](SymbolicMappingPropertySettings)

Introduce some operations about object properties.

[### Data Acquisition](TemplateManager)

The data acquisition entrance guides us to symbolically create maps. We can create data based on a template and specify a map and related feature templates, which can help us collect data effectively and conveniently.
