The snap modes are introduced below.

Icon | Description | Illustration  
---|---|---  
![](img-en/VerticalLine.png) | Make the current line segment perpendicular with the other linear element or its extension. Illustration: Drawing a line segment perpendicular with an existing one. | ![](img-en/VerticalLinePic.png)  
![](img-en/Parallel.png) | The current line segment is parallel to another line segment. Illustration: Drawing a line segment parallel to an existing one. | ![](img-en/ParallelPic.png)  
![](img-en/Horizontal.png) | Make current drawing line horizontal or vertical. Illustration: Drawing a horizontal line. | ![](img-en/HorizontalPic.png)  
![](img-en/IntersetPoint.png) |Draw the current line segment in intersection with the point on other feature. Illustration: Drawing a line segment passing by an endpoint of another line segment. | ![](img-en/IntersetPointPic.png)  
![](img-en/FixedLength.png) | Draw the current segment in a fixed length. Illustration: Drawing a line segment in a fixed length. | ![](img-en/FixedLengthPic.png)  
![](img-en/FixedAngle.png) | Draw the current line segment in a direction to make the angle between the segment and the previous one fixed. Illustration: Drawing a line segment 90 degrees from the former one.| ![](img-en/FixedAnglePic.png)  
![](img-en/SnappPoint.png) | Snap the drawing point to the endpoints or nodes of lines or border lines of polygons. Illustration: Snapping an endpoint of a line.| ![](img-en/SnappPointPic.png)  
![](img-en/HorVIntersetPoint.png) | Snap a point of other feature which the horizontal or vertical line passing by the current mouse pointer also passes. Illustration: Positioning an endpoint of a line segment which the horizontal line passing by the current mouse pointer also passes.| ![](img-en/HorVIntersetPointPic.png)  
![](img-en/OnLine.png) |Snap the drawing point to another line segment. Illustration: Snapping another line segment. | ![](img-en/OnLinePic.png)  
![](img-en/MiddlePoint.png) | Snap the drawing point to the middle vertex of an existing line segment. Illustration: Snapping the middle vertex of a line.| ![](img-en/MiddlePointPic.png)  
![](img-en/IntersectVertex.png) | Snap the drawing point to another point feature or vertex of other features Illustration: Snapping a vertex on another line.| ![](img-en/IntersectVertexPic.png)  
![](img-en/OnExtendLine.png) | Snap the drawing point to the prolonged line of an existing line segment Illustration: Snapping the extension of another line segment.| ![](img-en/OnExtendLinePic.png)
