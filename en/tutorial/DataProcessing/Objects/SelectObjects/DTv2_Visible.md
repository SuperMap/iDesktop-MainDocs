Controls the visibility of a vector layer.


### ![](../../../img/read.gif)Basic Steps

  1. Right click on a vector layer in Layer Manager and click Visible in the context menu that appears.
  2. When finished, a ![](img-en/EyeVisible.png) will show up in front of the Visible command, indicating that the layer is now visible.

### ![](../../../img/note.png) Notes

If the layer has been already set to visible, it isn't displayed in the map window. The reasons may be:

  * The layer contents have been filtered out. How to solve: Change the filter settings.
  * This layer is overlaid by other layer. How to solve: Move up this layer until it is visible.
