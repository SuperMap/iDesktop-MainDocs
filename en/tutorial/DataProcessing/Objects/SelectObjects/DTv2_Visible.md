Controls the visibility of a vector layer.
### Basic Steps
1. Right click on a vector layer in the **Layer Manager** and select **Visible** in the context menu that appears.

2. Or, right-click on a vector layer in the Layer Manager and select Layer Properties. In the popup Layer Properties panel, check **Visible**.
###  Notes

If the layer has been already set to visible, it isn't displayed in the map window. The reasons may be:
* The layer contents have been filtered out. How to solve: Change the filter settings.
* This layer is overlapped by other layer. How to solve: Move up this layer until it is visible.
