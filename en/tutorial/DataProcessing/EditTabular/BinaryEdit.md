### ![](../../img/read.gif) Introduction

Supports editing the binary field in the attribute table. You can save files
of different formats as the binary type to the field in the attribute table.

### ![](../../img/read.gif) Basic Steps

  1. Open the attribute table. In Workspace Manager, right click a dataset(vector dataset or tabular dataset), point to Browse Attribute on the context menu.
  2. Double-click a cell in the binary field list, click the ![](../../img/Select.png) button on the right of the cell, choose a file in the pop-up "Open" dialog, and then click Open button to save the file as a binary.
  3. When the binary cell displays "BinaryData", it means the cell has a value; if empty, it means no value.

### ![](../../img/note.png) Note

  1. The binary cell doesn't display the detailed binary value, just displays "BinaryData" uniformly.
  2. If the length of the binary field displays 0, it means its length can be changed, determined by the saved file. 
  3. If the selected file has been opened or not a local file, it can't be added to the cell successfully.
