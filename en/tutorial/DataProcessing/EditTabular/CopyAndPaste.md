### Note

1. The copy and paste of the attribute table can only be used to manipulate the contents of a non binary field, and can't be used to paste contents into the system field.
2. If the copied contents exceed the target field range or length, or their field types do not match, it will fail to be pasted, and the target cells will keep the original values.
3. When the attribute table is pasted, the upper left corner cell is selected in the attribute table as the starting position.
