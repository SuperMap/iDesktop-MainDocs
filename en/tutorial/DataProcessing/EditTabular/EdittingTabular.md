The **Attributes** tab is bound to the tabular dataset or the attribute table of a vector dataset. Only when you open an attribute table will the tab appear.

The **Attribute Table** tab organizes a series of features for the export, browse, and modification of attribute information.

To modify data attributes, you need to open the corresponding attribute table first. In the workspace manager, right-click on your vector dataset and select **Browse Attribute Table**. You are allowed to open attribute tables of several vector datasets from the same datasource by pressing Shift or Ctrl.

Groups organized on the Attributes tab include:

[Browse Attribute Table](Browsegroup)

[Edit Attribute Table](Editgroup)

[Field Statistics](StatisticAnalystgroup)

[Export Attribute Table](DatasetButton)
