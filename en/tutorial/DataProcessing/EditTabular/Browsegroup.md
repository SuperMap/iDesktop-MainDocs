Both the context menu and the **Browse** group on the **Attributes** tab
provide a series of commands for sorting, filtering and locating records,
hiding fields in attribute tables, and so on.

Right click on your dataset and select **Browse Attribute Table** to browse
its attributes. For a tabular dataset, you can double click it to open it
directly. To browse attribute tables of several datasets which need to come
from the same datasource, you can select all of them by using Shift or Ctrl
and select **Browse Attribute Table** in the context menu.
