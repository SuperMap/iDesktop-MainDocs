The "Highlighting Objects" function is used to set whether or not display all 
the selected objects in the associated map after selecting a whole column when 
associating browsing property table. And if the data is very large or it is 
associated browsing with a map, it will improve the operation efficiency that 
selecting the whole column without highlighting the objects.

When a attribute table associates with a map, select the whole column by 
clicking the column hear, and then click the right mouse button, select 
Highlighting Objects in the menu to highlight all objects in the associated 
map. This function doesn't applicable to large amounts of data. **Note**: 
When the map and the property table are associated with browsing, by default, 
the map window will not highlight the selected objects.
