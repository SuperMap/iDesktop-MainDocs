### Instructions

  * Field to Text converts a field of a dataset into a text dataset, realizing the labeling of the map. For example, we can convert the Capital field of the capitals dataset in the World datasource into a text dataset. If we display the result text dataset and the Countries dataset in the same map window, the result text dataset actually labels the Countries dataset.
  * The position of the text after conversion is determined by the interior point of the corresponding object. If the position of text after conversion is not satisfactory, you can change the alignment of the text to adjust the position of the text.
  * The function is applicable to point, line, region, text,3D point, 3D line, 3D region, 2D network data,3D network dataset and model network dataset.
