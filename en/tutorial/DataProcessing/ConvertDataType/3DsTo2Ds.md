  * Convert a 3D dataset (point, line, region) into a 2D dataset (point, line, region).
  * After conversion, the SMZ field will be deleted from the attribute table. Meanwhile, the Z value information will be removed from the node information. The Z value information will be removed from the node information for 3D line and 3D region datasets.

### ![](../../img-en/read.gif)Basic Steps

Here we take converting a 3D point dataset into a 2D point dataset as an
example.

  1. In the Data Processing group on the Data tab, click the Conversion dropdown arrow and select 3D Point to 2D Point.
  2. In the 3D Point -> 2D Point dialog box that shows up, specify the dataset to be converted, the target dataset name and set a datasource for saving the result dataset.
  3. Click "Convert" to complete the operation.
