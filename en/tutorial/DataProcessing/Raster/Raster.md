It is used to combine two or more raster datasets to a raster dataset that takes the geographic coordinates as reference.

[### Update Data](Append)

Use the contents of one or more raster datasets to update the corresponding parts of the other raster dataset.

[### Resample](RasterResample)

Assign the cell value or deduction value of original raster dataset to the pixel of new raster dataset.

[### Reclassify](RasterReclass)

Reclassify the cell values of the raster dataset and assign values for them according to the new classification criterion. Redefine each cell value in raster dataset.

[### Raster Algebraic Calculation](RasterMathAnalyst)

Conduct the mathematics and function operation for the raster dataset.
