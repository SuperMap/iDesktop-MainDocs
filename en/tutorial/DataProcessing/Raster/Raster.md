### Resample

Assigns the cell value or deduction value of original raster dataset to the pixel of new raster dataset.

### Reclassify

Reclassifies the cell values of the raster dataset and assign values for them according to the new classification criterion. Redefine each cell value in raster dataset.

### Raster Algebraic Calculation

Conducts the mathematics and function operation for the raster dataset.
