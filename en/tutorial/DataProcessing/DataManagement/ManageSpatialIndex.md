title: Managing Spatial Indexes  
---  
Spatial indexing is used to promote the query and access speed of geospatial data.

Spatial indexes of GIS are on the basis of field indexes. Since traditional field indexes cannot manage with the fast locating the spatial data that is spatially related, spatial indexes are necessary to improve the access speed of spatially related data.
