In the Workspace Manager, you can right click on the selected datasets to display the Properties window.


Notice that the Properties panel is a dock bar. It can be used for displaying
the properties of the datasets, workspace and datasource.

On the left is a catalog tree, with which the properties of the selected
datasets are classified and organized. The catalog tree varies for vector,
image and grid datasets. Therefore, properties of different types of datasets
cannot be displayed at the same time. But you can view the properties of
several datasets of the same type in the Properties window at the same time.

The catalog tree varies for vector, image and grid datasets.
