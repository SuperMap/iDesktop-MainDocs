Manging data include managing workspaces, datasources, datasets, spatial indexes, image pyramids, etc.

[

### Managing Workspaces

](AboutWorkspace-en.htm)

A workspace is where you work with your data. SuperMap supports the opening, saving, deleting operations of different types of workspaces.

[

### Managing Datasources

](AboutDataSource-en.htm)

A datasource stores spatial data independent of a workspace. According to the data engines, datasources include file, database, and Web datasources. You are allowed to create, open, delete, copy, compact, and sort datasources.

[

### Managing Datasets

](AboutDataset-en.htm)

Datasets supported by SuperMap include point, line, region, text, CAD, point3D, line3D, region3D, and tabular datasets. You are allowed to create, open, delete, copy, rename datasets and set encodings for them.

[

### Managing Spatial Indexes

](ManageSpatialIndex-en.htm)

SuperMap provides four types of spatial indexes applicable to vector datasets: Q-tree index, R-tree index, tile index and dynamic index. You are allowed to build or rebuild a type of spatial index for a dataset and manage spatial indexes already created for datasets.

[

### Managing Image Pyramids

](ManagePyromid-en.htm)

Image pyramid technology is used to enhance the performance of massive image
data. SuperMap allows you to create and delete image pyramids for datasets and
view image pyramid information.

[

### Recomputing Bounds for Vector Datasets

](DTv_Recalculate-en.htm)

You need to recompute dataset bounds after operations that may have changed
the dataset bounds.

[

### Recomputing Extremum for Grid Datasets

](DTr_Recalculate-en.htm)

You need to recompute dataset extremum after operations like resampling ,
changing resolution, etc. that may have changed the extremum of the datasets.

[

### Data Management Instance

](../../ApplicationTheme/DataManagement/DataManagement-en.htm)

provides rich sample codes. This section mainly introduces how to use  to
operate data, manage data and save the work results.
