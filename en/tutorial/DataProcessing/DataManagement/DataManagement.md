Managing data include managing workspaces, datasources, datasets, spatial indexes, image pyramids, etc.

[### Data Management Tool](CatalogManagement)

SuperMap provides a lot of easily used tools like catalog, searching, and workspace manager.

[### Managing Workspaces](WorkspaceManagent)

A workspace is where you work with your data. SuperMap supports the opening, saving, deleting operations of different types of workspaces.

[### Managing Datasources](AboutDataSource)

A datasource stores spatial data independent of a workspace. According to the data engines, datasources include file, database, and Web datasources. You are allowed to create, open, delete, copy, compact, and sort datasources.

[### Managing Datasets](AboutDataset)

Datasets supported by SuperMap include point, line, region, text, CAD, point3D, line3D, region3D, and tabular datasets. You are allowed to create, open, delete, copy, rename datasets and set encodings for them.

[### Managing Spatial Indexes](ManageSpatialIndex)

SuperMap provides four types of spatial indexes applicable to vector datasets: Q-tree index, R-tree index, tile index and dynamic index. You are allowed to build or rebuild a type of spatial index for a dataset and manage spatial indexes already created for datasets.

[### Managing Image Pyramids](PyromidManagement)

Image pyramid technology is used to enhance the performance of massive image data. SuperMap allows you to create and delete image pyramids for datasets and view image pyramid information.

[### Manage Mosaic Dataset](MosaicDataset)

Creating image pyramids is a common technology in terms of massive image data processing. SuperMap supports creating a mosaic dataset to manage massive images.
