### ![](../../img/read.gif)Instructions

The Save command allows you to save the workspace and all operating results 
you have achieved to the workspace. To save your operating results for future 
use, you need to save those results to the workspace first, and then save the 
workspace.

### ![](../../img/read.gif)Basic Steps

  1. On the Start tab, in the Workspace group, click Save. The button is only active if there are unsaved changes in the workspace.
  2. The Save dialog box will pop up if there are unsaved changes to maps, scenes or layouts in the workspace. 
    * All unsaved items are listed in the Save dialog box. A checked box indicates all changes to the item will be saved, while an unchecked box indicates that all changes will be dropped.
    * The Rename command allows you to change the name of the map, layout, or scene.
