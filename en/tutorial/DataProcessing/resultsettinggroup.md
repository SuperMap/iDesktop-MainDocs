Various functionalities in the Result Settings group are introduced in detail below:

  * **Save Result as Dataset**

The Save Result as Dataset check box is used to set whether to save the registration result. If this item is checked, the registration result can be saved as a new dataset, and the Datasource buttonDropdown and the Dataset text box are available; if this item is not checked, the original dataset will be overwritten.

  * **Datasource**

The buttonDropdown on the right side of the Datasource is used to select the datasource in which the registration result will be saved.

  * **Dataset**

The text box on the right side of the Dataset is used to input the name of the dataset in which the registration result will be saved. Input the name you want to save in the text box.

### ![](../../img/note.png)Note

The functionality of saving the result dataset provided by the Result Settings group of the Registration tab is similar to the functionality in the Registration Settings dialog box in the New Registration of the Data tab. Please see: [Registration Settings of the New Registration](NewRegistration.htm). The functionality of saving results provided here is mainly convenient for users to modify the position and name of saving results at any time.

For the readonly dataset, the registration result cannot be saved as a new dataset after the registration operation.
