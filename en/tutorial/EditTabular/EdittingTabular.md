The **Attributes** tab is bound to the tabular dataset or the attribute information of the vector dataset. Tabular information is the basis of geographic features, allowing you to visualize, query, and analyze your data. In the simplest terms, tables are made up of rows and columns, and all rows have the same columns. Rows are known as records and columns are fields. Each ield can store a specific type of data, such as a number, date, or piece of text.

The **Attributes** tab allows you to export, browse, edit and do statistics on the tabular information.

Groups organized on the Attributes tab include:
