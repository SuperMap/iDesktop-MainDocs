Update cells based on reference values in one or several consecutive cells by dragging the fill handle.

* **Note:** The cells you want to update and the references cells must be in the same field. Values in references cells will not be updated.

To update field in an open attribute table with the fill handle, you can:

    * **Select a cell and drag the fill handle to copy the value in the cell into cells you dragged over. Basic Steps:**
    1. Select a cell in the attribute table as the reference cell.
    2. Locate the mouse cursor carefully on the fill handle (the square at the bottom), until the cursor changes its shape into a "+". Click and drag the mouse.
    3. Release the left mouse button. The value is copied into all cells.

    * **Select a cell and drag the fill handle to create a sequence incremented or decremented by one. Basic Steps:**

    1. Select a cell in the attribute table as the reference cell.
    2. Locate the mouse cursor carefully on the fill handle (the square at the bottom), until the cursor changes its shape into a "+". Click and drag the mouse while holding down the Ctrl key.

    3. Release the left mouse key. 
If you drag down, a sequence incremented by one is formed.
If you drag up, a sequence decremented by one is formed.

    * **Select two consecutive cells and drag the fill handle to create a sequence incremented by the different between the values in two cells. Basic Steps:**

    1. Select two consecutive cells in the attribute table as referee cells.

    2. Locate the mouse cursor carefully on the fill handle (the square at the bottom), until the cursor changes its shape into a "+". Click and drag the mouse.

    3. Release the left mouse key. The difference between the first two values continues along the series.

    * **Select two consecutive cells and drag the fill handle to create a geometric sequence with the constant ratio between consecutive cells. Basic Steps:**

    1. Select two consecutive cells in the attribute table as referee cells.

    2. Locate the mouse cursor carefully on the fill handle (the square at the bottom), until the cursor changes its shape into a "+". Click and drag the mouse while holding down the Shift key.

    3. Release the left mouse key. The ratio between the first two values continues along the series.

    * **Select two consecutive cells and drag the fill handle to repeat the two values in the cells you dragged over. Basic Steps:**

    1. Select two consecutive cells in the attribute table as referee cells.

    2. Locate the mouse cursor carefully on the fill handle (the square at the bottom), until the cursor changes its shape into a "+". Click and drag the mouse while holding down the Ctrl key.

    3. Release the left mouse key. The first two values repeat along the series.

    * **Select multiple (more than two) consecutive cells and drag the fill handle to repeat the multiple values in the cells you dragged over. Basic Steps:**

    1. Select two consecutive cells in the attribute table as referee cells.

    2. Locate the mouse cursor carefully on the fill handle (the square at the bottom), until the cursor changes its shape into a "+". Click and drag the mouse.

    3. Release the left mouse key. The selected values repeat along the series.
