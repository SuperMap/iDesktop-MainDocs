Zoom out the map in focus.

On the **Layouts** tab, in the **Map** group, click the **Zoom Out** button to change the mouse pointer to ![](img-en/zoomoutStatus.png).

  * Zoom out by clicking a point: Click the map in focus to zoom out the map by 2 times.
  * Zoom out by dragging a box: Hold down the left mouse button and drag along the diagonal to draw a temporary box, and then release the left mouse button to zoom out the map in focus. The map will be zoomed out from the center of the temporary box by either the width, or height ratio of the map window and the box. The smaller ratio will be chosen as the zoom out factor.

Except for clicking the Zoom Out button, you can also press the X key on the keyboard to switch to the zoom out mode.
