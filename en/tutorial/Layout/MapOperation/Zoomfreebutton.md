Freely zoom in or out the map in focus.

On the **Layouts** tab, in the **Map** group, click the **Zoom Free** button to change the mouse pointer to ![](img-en/zoomFreeStatus.png).

  * Hold down the left mouse button and drag to zoom in or out the map in focus, then release the left mouse button and the map will be refreshed.
  * White areas may exist during the zoom free operation because the map is not instantly refreshed. For each zoom free operation, the map is refreshed after you release the left mouse button.
