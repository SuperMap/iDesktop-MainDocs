Zoom in the map in focus.

On the **Layouts** tab, in the **Map** group, click the **Zoom In** button to change the mouse pointer to ![](img-en/zoominStatus.png).

  * Zoom in by clicking a point: Click the map in focus to zoom in the map by 2 times.
  * Zoom in by dragging a box: Hold down the left mouse button and drag along the diagonal to draw a temporary box, and then release the left mouse button to zoom in the map. The map will be zoomed in from the center of the temporary box by either the width, or height ratio of the map window and the box. The smaller ratio will be chosen as the zoom in factor.

Except for clicking the Zoom In button, you can also press the Z key on the keyboard to switch to the zoom in mode.
