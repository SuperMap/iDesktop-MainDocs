title: Focusing a Map
---
Focus a map to activate it. Focusing the map allows you to browse it without applying the operations to other elements in the layout window.

  * To focus a map, select it first, then click **Focus Map** in the **Map** group under the "Layouts" tab. When a map gets focus, all other commands in the "Map" group will be activated. 
  * When a map is in focus, you can click Focus Map again to cancel the focus.
