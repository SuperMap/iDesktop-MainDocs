The Pan command allows you to pan across the map in focus by dragging.

On the **Layout** tab, in the **Map** group, click the **Pan** button to change the mouse pointer to ![](img-en/panStatus.png).

  * In the frame of the map in focus, hold down the left mouse button and drag to move the map in focus with the mouse pointer. When you release the left mouse button, the map will be refreshed.
  * White areas may exist during the pan operation because the map is not instantly refreshed. For each pan operation, the map is refreshed after you release the left mouse button.

Except for clicking the Zoom In button, you can also press the A key on the keyboard to switch to the pan mode.
