The Start Menu/Close/Workspace command allows you to close the current open 
workspace. When the current open workspace is closed, another empty workspace 
will be opened.

  2.If there are no unsaved changes in the workspace, the workspace will be closed without any prompt. However, iDesktop will remind you to save the changes.

You can click No to drop the changes, or click Yes to save the changes.

    * If the workspace is an existing one, the workspace will be closed with all changes saved.
    * If the workspace hasn't been saved before, you need to save the workspace first.
