Dynamic segmentation is a method for dynamic positioning which stores
geographic positions with the relative positions of linear features. Using the
dynamic segmentation tool in SuperMap, you can locate events in event table on
route dataset. This document introduce dynamic segmentation from some aspects:
the related concepts, general workflow, creating route, calibrating route,
creating event table, the management of the relation between routes and event
tables, etc.
