### Note

- To end drawing, you can:
    -   Right-click anywhere in the map window where any non-text box is located.
    -   Or click the button in the Text Objects group again.

- Alongline Text is composed of several sub text objects. A single Chinese character, a continuous alphabet, and a continuous number are treated as a sub-text object. A space character is not counted as a sub object, and is used to separate consecutive characters or numbers. For continuous letters or numbers, you need to add space between them to achieve the alongline text effect, otherwise it will as a sub-object. You can view and modify content of every sub object in "Property" dialog box.
- The direction of Alongline Text is a curve direction, so when creating alongline text, pay attention to the direction of the curve drawn.
