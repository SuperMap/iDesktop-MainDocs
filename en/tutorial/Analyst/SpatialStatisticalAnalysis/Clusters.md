Cluster Analysis contains [hot spot analysis](HotSpotAnalyst), [cluster
and outlier analysis](ClusterOutlierAnalyst). Through cluster analysis to
identify the locations of statistically significant hot spots, cold spots,
spatial outliers, and similar features, help us to analyze problems. For
example, in the analysis of crime, we can study which locations are frequently
involved in crime and gather, which has an important supporting role for the
additional police force.

Cluster analysis is a statistical method to classify the objects of data.
Class of methods such as cluster methods have a common characteristic:do not
know in advance the number of categories and structure, which is the analysis
of the data object (similarity) between the similarity and differences
(dissimilarity) data. These similar (different) data can be seen as a measure
of the distance between objects and objects. It is a common thread in the
cluster analysis method to view the object of distance as a class, and the
object distance between different species is far away.

Cluster analysis can solve the following problems:

  * Where are the cluster or cold spots and hot spots?
  * Where is the location of the abnormal value of the space?
  * What features are very similar?
