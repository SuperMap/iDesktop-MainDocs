title: Conversion between Vector and Raster
---
This section introduces the conversion operation between vector dataset and raster dataset.

### [Vector to Raster](VectortoRaster)

Introduces how to convert the vector dataset into grid dataset.

### [Raster to Vector](RasterToVector)

Introduces how to convert the raster dataset into vector dataset. SuperMap provides B Spline, POLISH methods to finish the vectorization operation.

### [Raster Refining](ThinRaster)

In the introduction of converting Raster data into the line data, if it refines the raster data, it will achieve a better display effect.
