title: The proximity analysis result class.  
---  
In real life, you often encounter cases like the following:

  * Which is the closest residence to the landslide?
  * Which are the two supermarkets within 2 km that are closest to the national stadium?
  * How to map the coverages of the telecommunication towers from strong to weak?
  * How many food production factories within 1000 meters of a polluted river stream?
  * There are two layers. One for football games avenues, the other for hotels. What is the distance from each hotel to the nearest avenue?

The above questions are all related to locations and distances. Proximity
analyses provide functions to determine the proximity among multiple or
between two features, including buffer analysis, Thiessen polygons,
calculating distances, distance query, spatial query, etc.
