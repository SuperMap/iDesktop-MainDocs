In terms of the structure type of the spatial data to be processed, GIS
spatial analyses can be categorized into two modes: raster data analyses and
vector data analyses.

Vector analysis functions in the application program include: Buffer analysis;
Overlay analysis.

### [Buffer Analysis](bufferanalyst/Bufferanalyst)

Buffer Analysis is a process of building zones with a certain width around
point, line, or region geometric objects according to a specified buffer
distance.

### [Overlay Analysis](overlayanalyst/Overlayanalyst)

Overlay analysis is a process of generating a new dataset by overlaying two
datasets with different themes. An overlay analysis result carries over the
attributes of the features from two or more original layers.

### [Dynamic Segmentation](../../DynamicSeg/DynamicS)

It is used to introduce the principle and concepts of dynamic segmentation.
For example, the general process, create route, calibrate route, create the
event table, manage the routes and event tables.
