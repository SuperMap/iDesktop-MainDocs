title: Extract Isolines by Points
---
### Instructions

Extracts all the isolines with altitudes equal to the values at the mouse-clicked locations.

  * The source dataset from which isolines are extracted must be a DEM or a Grid dataset.

**Sample Application**

Open the datasource Terrain in the folder ExerciseData/RasterAnalysis. The datasource includes DEM data with the resolution of 5 meter.

### Functional Entrances

  * Click the **Spatial Analysis** > **Raster Analysis** > **Surface Analysis** > **Extract Isolines** > **Extract Isolines by Points**. 
  * **Toolbox** > **Raster Analysis** > **Surface Analysis** > **Extract Isolines** > **Extract Isolines by Points**. (iDesktopX)

###  Main Parameters

  1. Move your mouse on the map, and the mouse will become a cross, click on the map to select one or more points which need to extract the contours:
