### Introduction

Calculates the surface area of raster. It calculates the total surface area of the simulated curved surface of the raster dataset in the selected polygon region.

### Basic Steps

**Surface Area**

  1. Open the raster dataset to calculate surface area in the map window. Note that this functionality is enabled only when there is raster data opened in the current workspace.
  2. Click **Spatial Analysis** > **Raster Analysis** > **Surface Analysis** > **Surface Area**.
  3. Draw a polygon on the map, and right click to complete the operation. The size of the raster surface of the temporary polygon will be shown in the map window and the output window. The default unit is square meters. You can clear the temporary polygon by press Esc key. 

**Select Polygon Area**

  1. If there are both raster data and region data opened in the map window, select one or more polygons (you can press and hold the Shift key to select multiple polygon objects).
  2. Click **Spatial Analysis** > **Raster Analysis** > **Surface Analysis** > **Select Polygon Area**.
  3. The size of the surface area will be displayed in the map window and the output window.

Or you can:

  1. Click **Spatial Analysis** > **Raster Analysis** > **Surface Analysis** > **Select Polygon Area**.
  2. Select one or more polygons you want to calculate, and right click to finish the selection.
  3. The size of the surface area will be displayed in the map window and the output window.

Note: When there are more than one polygons selected, the result value will be the sum of all the polygons. You can press the Esc key to clear the selected state of the polygon(s) in the map window.
