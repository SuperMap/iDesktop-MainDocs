title: Extracting Isolines
---
The raster analysis functions in the application program provide three methods to extract isolines:

### [Extract All Isolines](DriveContourAll)

All the isolines satisfying the condition are extracted from a surface model according to specified parameters.

### [Specified Isolines](DriveContourSpecific)

Isolines with specific values are extracted as needed.

### [Isolines from Click](DriveContourPoint)

Click on the surface to select isolines interactively. The isolines with values equal to the altitude at selected points are extracted.
