　　A workspace is where you operate on your data. A workspace must be created first before any operations. All of your work, such as the datasources opened, maps, layouts and scenes you configured, etc., can be saved in a workspace for future use.
  
### Workspace types
  
According to how workspaces are stored, there are two types: file workspace and database workspace.

* **File workspace**: Your workspace is saved as two files that extensions are *.sxw/*.smw or *.sxwu/*.smwu.
* **Database workspace**: Your workspace is saved into a database. Currently, the supportive database workspaces include: SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, DM.
    
### Workspace structure
  
In SuperMap iDesktop, one workspace corresponds with one workspace consisting of a tree structure, and the datasource collection, map collection, layout collection, scene collection, symbol library collection in a datasource are unique.
 
Datasource collections are used for managing all datasources opened in your workspace. Map/Layout collections are used for saving maps/layouts in your workspace. 3D scene collections are used for saving 3D scenes and the symbol library collections are used for managing symbol libraries.
Existing of maps, layouts, 3D scenes and symbol resources depends on workspaces, that means all of them are saved into workspaces. When you delete a workspace, maps, layouts, scenes and symbol resources are deleted as well in the workspace but datasources which are saves independently, and only the interrelationships between them are deleted.

### Open a workspace
   

Three ways are provided to open a workspace:
